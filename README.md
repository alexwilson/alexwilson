# Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I currently work on platforms at a fintech company. Previously I've worked on new products, product enablement, cyber security, infrastructure engineering and app development.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about product-management and machine-learning.  Also music production, but like, slowly.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on tech for good (including web performance, because bandwidth costs money and javascript is slow).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about product development, engineering management and the web.

- ðŸ“« To reach me contact me on [Bluesky](https://alexwilson.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alexwilson) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexwilsonv1).
